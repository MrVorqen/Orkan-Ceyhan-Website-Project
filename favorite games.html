        <p id="re2-paragraf">
            Resident Evil 2 is a 2019 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. 
            A remake of the 1998 game Resident Evil 2, it was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in January 2019 and for Amazon Luna, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2022, and a Nintendo Switch cloud version released in November 2022. 
            Players control the rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and the college student Claire Redfield as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a zombie uprising.
            Capcom considered remaking Resident Evil 2 following the release of the remake of the first Resident Evil in 2002. It was delayed as the producer, Shinji Mikami, did not want to divert development from Resident Evil 4 (2005). 
            Capcom announced the Resident Evil 2 remake in August 2015 and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at E3 2018.
